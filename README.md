# Scala Project

## Project features
Please open the project as being a Scala project in IntelliJ IDE. The features offered by the project can be used threw IntelliJ's terminal.
All the code of the project is in the file Main.scala, you can find it in src/ScalaProject.

## Resources used
The CSV file used as first input of the project is in the folder CSVs.
A sample of the JSON file produced by the project can be seen in the folder JSONs.

## What object and why
The research did on the lines of the CSV file is based on the number of attributes and their types. Car and Person have the same caracteristics, the method used to differentiate them is based on the numberOfChildren/speeds values. If the value is under 25 then we admit that it is a number of children and chose a Person, if not then we chose a Car.

## Step of the subject followed 
Pretty much everything has been developed in the project.
Things that still need to be done :
1. Execute the program with a JSON file as entry (parsing needed)


## Important fact
A global variable in the Object Main is displayDevs, it is set as 0 but feel free to change the value at 1 for more details on what's happening.
